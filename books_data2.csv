This book introduces students with little or no prior programming experience to the art of computational problem solving using Python and various Python libraries, including PyLab. It provides students with skills that will enable them to make productive use of computational techniques, including some of the tools and techniques of data science for using computation to model and interpret data. The book is based on an MIT course (which became the most popular course offered through MIT's OpenCourseWare) and was developed for use not only in a conventional classroom but in in a massive open online course (MOOC). This new edition has been updated for Python 3, reorganized to make it easier to use for courses that cover only a subset of the material, and offers additional material including five new chapters. Students are introduced to Python and the basics of programming in the context of such computational concepts and techniques as exhaustive enumeration, bisection search, and efficient approximation algorithms. Although it covers such traditional topics as computational complexity and simple algorithms, the book focuses on a wide range of topics not found in most introductory texts, including information visualization, simulations to model randomness, computational techniques to understand data, and statistical techniques that inform (and misinform) as well as two related but relatively advanced topics: optimization problems and dynamic programming.

In recent years, many successful electronic learning applications have been made, from data mining systems that learn to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, filtering programs that learn user readings, to private cars that learn to drive on public highways. At the same time, there have been significant developments in the concepts and algorithms that form the basis for this field. Machine learning is programming computers to optimize a performance criterion using example data or past experience. The goal of this textbook is to present the key concepts of Machine Learning which includes Python concepts and Interpreter, Foundation of Machine Learning, Data Pre-processing, Supervised Machine Learning, Unsupervised Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Kernel Machine, Design and analysis of Machine Learning experiment and Data visualization. The theoretical concepts along with coding implementation are covered. This book aims to pursue a middle ground between a theoretical textbook and one that focuses on applications. The book concentrates on the important ideas in machine learning""--",ISBN_10,False,False,182,Computers,en,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XWh6zgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,0,0.0,IN,NOT_FOR_SALE,False,0.0,N/A,0.0,N/A,N/A,2021,Nova Science Publishers
